===================

A command-line tool to setup a speech corpus for training an acoustic model for CMU Sphinx.

TODO
----

- Only one corpus to be composed of training and testing parts.
- Split the collection of audios in training and testing parts by audio's count (unlike the currently speaker's count).
- Increase the coverage of the tests.
- Create a Audio class.
- Compile information about the database (_ total hours, train/test percentage, last update, etc _)
- Remove the hard-coded formats in classes.
- Enhance the logging.
- Support configuration file.
